Contamination identified includes clinker (a waste by-product from smelting metals), metals (arsenic, copper, lead), DRO, VOC, and PAH (BaP equivalents). A TBRA application in the Spring 2006 was not recommended for funding due to relatively low contamination over a large part of the site related more to geotechnical concerns than to soil remediation. A change in the development plan to use existing adjacent structured parking rather than underground parking for the hotel and allowing for a slab-on-grade building indicates a more limited need for excavation. The current award takes into account limited areas of higher contamination related to the clinker- and lead-impacted soil. Funds are to be used to remediate approximately 200 cubic yards of lead- and BaP-impacted fill, and approximately 2,000 cubic yards of clinker-impacted fill, as well as for environmental oversight.
