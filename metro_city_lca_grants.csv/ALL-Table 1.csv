The property has been rezoned to high-density office and residential and will be a transit-oriented development, although the Metropolitan Council has not determined that the Southwest LRT will have an alignment that serves this area with a Van White station at Linden Yards. In April 2010 Ryan Companies was granted 5 years' exclusive development rights by the Minneapolis City Council for Linden Yards West. Ryan proposes to recruit corporate tenants to occupy one or more eight-to-twelve story structures and will work with a housing partner to provide multi-family housing. One challenge to redeveloping Linden Yards is that the Hennepin County Regional Rail Authority (HCRRA) is strongly considering the acquisition of the eastern half of Linden Yards for a commuter rail layover facility. The goal of the grant is to assemble a design and engineering team to represent the future development potential, to work with HCRRA and its consultants to analyze the factors that must be addressed in order to determine the technical and financial feasibility of developments above a rail layover facility. An initial concept is to construct a development platform with pilings/supports spaced between the planned sets of railroad storage tracks in a manner that would not later disrupt rail layover operations. The soil structure is poor in this area so significant piling will be needed to construct a development platform to support mid-level office or housing structures to be developed in Phase 2 of the Ryan development. This will allow the rail facility to successfully co-exist with vertical development in Linden Yards East and provide important development density and ridership to support to Southwest LRT line.",Predevelopment planning,Linden Yard,N/A,Closed,2010-402," $	100,000.00 "," $	100,000.00 ",,SW corner of Linden & Lyndale in Minneapolis,Minneapolis,Hennepin,6,61A,12/8/10,,12/31/12,,1/26/11,1/4/11,3/10/11,3/11/11,3/11/11,,,,,2010,11002122,01003,LCDA Pre-Development Historical Data,LCDA Pre-Development

The TBRA award for $44,400 was requested as matching funds for a $256,170 request from DEED for soil remediation of a 1.13-acre site formerly used as an industrial chemical warehouse and freight facility. Contamination identified includes clinker (a waste by-product from smelting metals), metals (arsenic, copper, lead), DRO, VOC, and PAH (BaP equivalents). A TBRA application in the Spring 2006 was not recommended for funding due to relatively low contamination over a large part of the site related more to geotechnical concerns than to soil remediation. A change in the development plan to use existing adjacent structured parking rather than underground parking for the hotel and allowing for a slab-on-grade building indicates a more limited need for excavation. The current award takes into account limited areas of higher contamination related to the clinker- and lead-impacted soil. Funds are to be used to remediate approximately 200 cubic yards of lead- and BaP-impacted fill, and approximately 2,000 cubic yards of clinker-impacted fill, as well as for environmental oversight.

The new design also restricts access in and out of Newport with only one entry point located at Glen Road. While these improvements have benefitted traffic operations for the region, the City of Newport is now divided into two distinct parts with a significant challenge of uniting both halves of the city. Further, a significant portion of the city's tax base has been lost to highways, and several businesses have closed. There are several areas in the city where land is underutilized and/or structures are outdated. The recent station area planning process has prompted a proactive look at how the city can recover. The Red Rock Commuter Rail station area planning process will be completed in early 2011, and bus route #364 will be re-routed to the site beginning 2012. The objectives of the three activities are to create land use and implementation tools to guide development around the transit site and unite the City of Newport; update the comprehensive trail plan; identify the potential commercial and residential market opportunities that not only support the station area but recover tax base and create new housing stock for the City; and prepare redevelopment strategies that accomplish these goals.",Redevelopment study,,N/A,Closed,2010-402," $	69,350.00 "," $	64,819.27 ",,"Sof 494, W of 61 & N of 20th St in Newport",Newport,Washington,13,54A,12/8/10,,12/31/12,,1/26/11,1/18/11,2/25/11,3/1/11,3/2/11,,,,,2010,110001721,01003,LCDA Pre-Development Historical Data,LCDA Pre-Development

Historically, residential use prevailed from 1917 to the 1950s, followed by railroad use until 1982.  The land has been mined since 1959 and gradually replaced with piles of rubble.  An extensive assessment of the site identified the need for significant soil and groundwater remediation.  Four areas are contaminated with metals, VOCs and PAHs.  The portion of the site used for scrap metal and auto storage and crushing is affected by VOCs, PAHs, PCBs, diesel range organics, gasoline range organics and various metals.  The groundwater at three locations on the site is contaminated with VOCs and PAHs.  Remediation will include excavation of hot spot areas, a vapor extraction system and long-term monitoring. The  TBRA funds awarded in 1999 will cover an additional portion of the costs associated with soil cleanup work completed on the site. A public-private partnership was established to promote development along the corridor.  The partnership includes customized job training, apprenticeship programs, a business retention/attraction taskforce, and a long-range funding task force. An attractive industrial park with landscaping, sidewalks, and stormwater management ponds has been developed on the site, and 348,480-sq. ft. of building floor space is substantially constructed.  Five businesses are already established on the site. Together, the three TBRA grants have provided this project with $1,291,651.",Industrial,Williams Hill,N/A,Closed,," $	144,151.00 "," $	144,151.00 ",,"Btwn I-35E, University, John and Pennsylvania Sts. - St. Paul",St. Paul,Ramsey,13,67B,12/15/99,,,,,,,2/18/00,,,,,,1999,,01006,TBRA Cleanup Historical Data,TBRA Cleanup

Reconstructing Oneida Street, thus reinstating a smaller block pattern, is in keeping with the new pedestrian-friendly urban village planned for the site as well as helping to reconnect the site to the larger existing neighborhood by relating to the surrounding street grid. Oneida Street will also serve as the ""front door"" for Phase One adaptive reuse of the historic Bottle House, which will be converted into 96 units of affordable housing by Domimium Development. The construction of Oneida St. and the Bottle House project is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2009.

Walkways, parking lots and other hard surfaces will be composed of pervious materials that allow for water infiltration.
