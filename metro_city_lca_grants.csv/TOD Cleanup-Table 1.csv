The project is a comprehensive approach to create the optimal link between the Station and Mainstreet. The approach has three major components: 1). Design and build a streetscape along 8th Avenue that uses bicycle lanes, public art, sidewalks, street furniture and other TOD standards to link the Station to Mainstreet, 2). Assemble and prepare land for a shared public parking ramp on 8th Avenue north of Mainstreet to direct parking needs away from the Station and TOD within 1/4 mile, and 3).
