An initial concept is to construct a development platform with pilings/supports spaced between the planned sets of railroad storage tracks in a manner that would not later disrupt rail layover operations. The soil structure is poor in this area so significant piling will be needed to construct a development platform to support mid-level office or housing structures to be developed in Phase 2 of the Ryan development.

The size and design of the recently-constructed Wakota Bridge and Highway 61 interchange, plus the size, width and height of the Highway 61 right of way and noise walls have divided the City of Newport in half and have blocked visibility into the city along the corridor. The new design also restricts access in and out of Newport with only one entry point located at Glen Road. While these improvements have benefitted traffic operations for the region, the City of Newport is now divided into two distinct parts with a significant challenge of uniting both halves of the city. Further, a significant portion of the city's tax base has been lost to highways, and several businesses have closed. There are several areas in the city where land is underutilized and/or structures are outdated. The recent station area planning process has prompted a proactive look at how the city can recover. The Red Rock Commuter Rail station area planning process will be completed in early 2011, and bus route #364 will be re-routed to the site beginning 2012. The objectives of the three activities are to create land use and implementation tools to guide development around the transit site and unite the City of Newport; update the comprehensive trail plan; identify the potential commercial and residential market opportunities that not only support the station area but recover tax base and create new housing stock for the City; and prepare redevelopment strategies that accomplish these goals.",Redevelopment study,,N/A,Closed,2010-402," $	69,350.00 "," $	64,819.27 ",,"Sof 494, W of 61 & N of 20th St in Newport",Newport,Washington,13,54A,12/8/10,,12/31/12,,1/26/11,1/18/11,2/25/11,3/1/11,3/2/11,,,,,2010,110001721,01003,LCDA Pre-Development Historical Data,LCDA Pre-Development
