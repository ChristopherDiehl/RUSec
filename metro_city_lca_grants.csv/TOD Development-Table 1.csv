The Project will demonstrate that sustainably designed innovative urban housing can attract intergenerational residents who value the ability to live and work in a transit centered community, decreasing automobile dependence. The Prospect Park East River Road Improvement Association (PPERRIA) and the City of Minneapolis have identified the Boeser site as a top priority for redevelopment as part of a larger master plan to create a walkable arts-centered cultural district with a vibrant mix of housing, retail, and commercial uses. The vision of PPERRIA as laid out in ""Prospect Park 2020"" fits with TCG's mission ""to create great places to live, work, and play."" TCG plans to remove the blighted building, remediate environmental issues, and construct approximately 250 units of energy efficient housing on the site that will catalyze private investment in the Station Area. The goal is to create a site that incorporates sustainability, active living, public art, urban agriculture, and nature and open space.",Mixed income rental housing,Prospect Park Station,N/A,Closed,2012-126," $	2,000,000.00 "," $	2,000,000.00 ",,2901 4th St SE,Minneapolis,Hennepin,8,60B,4/25/12,,4/30/15,,6/18/12,6/18/12,7/30/12,8/3/12,8/4/12,,,,,2011,12005767,01004,TOD Development Historical Data,TOD DevelopmentÂ
